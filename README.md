## About
- This is a simple lottery smart contract where every one can send some ethers and get the lottery ticket. For every set of time interval the picking up winner function is called automatically using **CHAINLINK KEEPERS**. There will be a ramdom number is generated using CHAINLINK random number generator and using some mathematical calculations(modulus) the winner is picked all the money is transfered to that winner.
  
## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/ramachandrareddy352/lottery-contract
cd lottery-contract
forge build
```
# Usage

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Library

If you're having a hard time installing the chainlink library, you can optionally run this command. 

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Deploy - Other Network

[See below](#deployment-to-a-testnet-or-mainnet)

## Testing

We talk about 4 test tiers in the video.

1. Unit
2. Integration
3. Forked
4. Staging

This repo we cover #1 and #3.

```
forge test
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

This will setup a ChainlinkVRF Subscription for you. If you already have one, update it in the `scripts/HelperConfig.s.sol` file. It will also automatically add your contract as a consumer.

3. Register a Chainlink Automation Upkeep

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts)

Go to [automation.chain.link](https://automation.chain.link/new) and register a new upkeep. Choose `Custom logic` as your trigger mechanism for automation. Your UI will look something like this once completed:

![Automation](./img/automation.png)

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```
